# twilio-email-send

> [!info] What it does
> Use when the caller has Twilio credentials (Account SID + Auth Token or API Key SID + Secret) and needs to send email via comms.twilio.com/v1/Emails. This is Twilio-native email — NOT SendGrid. Do NOT use if the caller has a SendGrid API key (SG.-prefix) — use twilio-sendgrid-email-send instead. Covers single sends, batch sends up to 10,000 recipients, Liquid personalization, operation tracking, and error handling.
