# heygen-video

> [!info] What it does
> Generate HeyGen presenter videos via the v3 Video Agent pipeline — handles Frame Check (aspect ratio correction), prompt engineering, avatar resolution, and voice selection. Required for any HeyGen video generation. Replaces deprecated endpoints with v3. Use when: (1) generating any HeyGen video (via API or otherwise), (2) sending a personalized video message (outreach, update, announcement, pitch, knowledge), (3) creating a HeyGen presenter-led explainer, tutorial, or product demo with a human face, (4) "make a video of me saying...", "send a video to my leads", "record an update for my team", "create a video pitch", "make a loom-style message", "I want to appear in this video", "generate a HeyGen video", "make a talking head video". Accepts avatar_id from heygen-avatar for identity-first HeyGen videos, or uses a stock presenter. Returns video share URL + HeyGen session URL for iteration. Chain signal: when the user wants to create/design an avatar AND make a video in the same request, run heygen-avatar first, then return here. Conjunctions to watch: "and then", "and immediately", "first...then", "X and make a video", "design [presenter] and record" = always CHAIN. If the user provides a photo AND wants a video, route to heygen-avatar first. NOT for: avatar creation or identity setup (use heygen-avatar first), cinematic footage or b-roll without a presenter, translating videos, TTS-only, or streaming avatars.
